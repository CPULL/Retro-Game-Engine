Documentation on the Wiki of Github
Arcade: Custom fonts
Audio: have the wave generation to be perfectly cyclic so we will avoid "thicks" when the sample is regenerated

Parser: add ToString for the missing BNF values (music)


FUTURE: Code editor
FUTURE: Font editor
FUTURE: step by step debugger
FUTURE: map keys


Add a "image" command to draw on the screen a texture (like sprite or tile, no size limit here)
Image(address, posx, posy)

split the cartridge in 2 files.
One with the code and some parameters (.cartridge)
One (.rom) with the data

Data can still be kept in the cartridge for slow parsing.

Data should have a set of label names. Each with the offset in the byte[] data
And then a byte[] with the actual rom


* write bytereader to read this data
* update LoadCartridge in arcade to load also .rom files
* update all dev tools to save/load also in binary format
