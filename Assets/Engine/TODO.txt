Documentation on the Wiki of Github
Audio: have the wave generation to be perfectly cyclic so we will avoid "thicks" when the sample is regenerated


FUTURE: precompile Nodes
FUTURE: Font editor
FUTURE: Custom fonts
FUTURE: Favorites in FileBrowser
FUTURE: map keys
FUTURE: load/save capabilities




Arcade: Handle loading errors (data size is shorter than expected): music, arcade


Music editor: add a few empty lines at begin and end of the view, and have some sort of highlighted line on the center


Rom Editor: [DECIDE] have a way to add some raw binary data (loading a file or using some sort of text or hex editor)
Rom editor: Add a button to remove all selected lines
Rom editor: Add "Edit" buttons in RomEdit (music, tilemap)


CodeEditor: Save code as binary
CodeEditor: Load code as binary

BUG: Config->Screen is not correctly parsed/formatted (to debug)

CodeEditor: View memory
CodeEditor: real time editing of nodes while debugging

Code replacement
Check the time of the last compile and the last code edit
If the code edit is after the compile, recompile and:
> if not compiling just show errors but do nothing arcade side
> set the values of the new variables by getting the variables with the same name in the previous variables
> replace the code when the frame is completed

WHEN?
if running or paused, replace if code compiles at end of frame. When compiling with button or re-clicking on run/reload
if not running, run the code only if clicking the run button, if not do not replace anything
