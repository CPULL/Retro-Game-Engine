wait() should not block the framerate

Add "Edit" buttons in RomEdit (music, tilemap)

Add global TryCatch in Dev tools
Handle loading errors (data size is shorter than expected): music, arcade

Bug: We had some spurious tiles in a tilemap when the items were deleted

Add palette (probably it is already done and working)
Add DevTool Palette editor
Update Sprite and Tilemap editors to use Palette
Add a way to copy a block of memory
Extend the setpalette to set just a subset of colors
be sure images and sprite rom definition always start with the sizes

in config add: palette mode on off and keymap to define keys for the game
