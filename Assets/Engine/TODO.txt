FUTURE: Font editor

FUTURE: map keys
FUTURE: load/save capabilities
FUTURE: mouse support in Arcade



Arcade: Handle loading errors (data size is shorter than expected): music, arcade


Music editor: add a few empty lines at begin and end of the view, and have some sort of highlighted line on the center


Rom Editor: [DECIDE] have a way to add some raw binary data (loading a file or using some sort of text or hex editor)
Rom editor: Add a button to remove all selected lines
Rom editor: Add "Edit" buttons in RomEdit (music, tilemap)


CodeEditor: View memory

Check the tracker
Test all wave forms and reduce their thiks if any

The idea is to have the pos to vary from the min to the max of the cycle. So, not necessarily samplerate values


FIXME: function local variables should be removed (set to NULL) at each run
Warn about using non-initialized variables

Allow arr[] = {1, 2, 4.5, "6" } and have 4 values in the array


Rewrite the palette editor, and be sure we use it when importing sprites, tilemaps, and images
