Tiles, with priority byte
Tilemap editor
Code editor
Documentation on the Wiki of Github
Font editor
Custom fonts
have the wave generation to be perfectly cyclic so we will avoid "thicks" when the sample is regenerated

disable sprites and tilemaps on errors?
once parser is completed use as keys shorter strings, removing the first two characters

FUTURE: step by step debugger
FUTURE: map keys

TEST: import/export from tilemap editor

add ToString for the missing BNF values

in spriteeditor do not remove the provious draw mode, and make it visible when selected (like done for Tilemapeditor)
spriteeditor: fill highlights the wrong icon

Complete tilemaps in Engine:
* size according to screen
* add/remove/change tiles
* scroll
* change priority
