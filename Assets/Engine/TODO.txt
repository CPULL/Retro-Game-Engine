Add a way to copy a block of memory

In music editor add a few empty lines at begin and end of the view, and have some sort of highlighted line on the center
Add a way in roms to add a generic set of data (hex editor)


Bug: We had some spurious tiles in a tilemap when the items were deleted
Bug: wait() should not block the framerate


!in config add: palette mode on off and keymap to define keys for the game
when starting up set the palette shader if the palette is active, set the default colors for the shader (use DoIt to have it enabled or disabled)
