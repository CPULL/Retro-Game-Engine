Add "Edit" buttons in RomEdit (music, tilemap)

Add global TryCatch in Dev tools
Handle loading errors (data size is shorter than expected): music, arcade


Add palette (probably it is already done and working)
Update Sprite and Tilemap editors to use Palette
Add a way to copy a block of memory
Extend the setpalette to set just a subset of colors

in config add: palette mode on off and keymap to define keys for the game

In music editor add a few empty lines at begin and end of the view, and have some sort of highlighted line on the center
Change mode for hex and bin (use postfixes)
Add a way in roms to add a generic set of data (hex editor)


Bug: We had some spurious tiles in a tilemap when the items were deleted
Bug: wait() should not block the framerate
